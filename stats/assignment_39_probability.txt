A:

1: it arrives at 8 but takes 20 minutes to get there. Then it takes between 0 and 15 minutes on top of that so the average would be 7.5 so you expect to get to work at around 8:27.5.

2)
It takes 20 mins to get there again. This one arives at 8:05 so we get 8:25 then we have 0 to 10 mins delay so the avg  is actually 8:30.

3) It would be 11/16, one for every minute of delay zero to fifteen and this is around 68 percent.

4) Same principle as above except this time its 6/11, because there's 11 different variations this time.

B:

1) Expected Probability: Int(x* p(x)) from -infinity to infinity

int(0) from -infitiy to zero and 10xe^-10x from 0 to infinity

ignore first integral instead the second one becomes -xe^-10x - e^-10x/10. so now putting in valuse of x as
the limits, the whole first term of infinity goes to zero. and then the first term of the second bunch also goes
to zero because of the x and then the last term becomes 1/10 so the avg is 0.1

0 - (0 - 1/10) = 1/10

2) Int(p(x)) from 60 to infinity

the integral of p(x) is -e^-10x the infinity side goes to zero again so it becomes

0 - (-e^(-10 * 60)) so e^(-600) = 2.650397e-261

so the probability of staying for more than a min is 2.65-261 percent.

3) int(p(x)) from 0 to p

same thing as before -e^(-10x) is the integral 

it would be -e^(-10p) - (-e^0) = .99999
so then it becomes e^-10p = -0.00001

-10p = ln(-0.00001)
p = ln(-0.00001)/-10
p = 1.15

 the probability of coming out of the wormhole within 1.15 seconds is  99.999%.

 4) seconds in a day = 86400

 int(p(x)) from 86400 to infinity
 integral same as above
 -e^(-10x) at infinity = 0 so then it becomes

 0 - (-e^(-10*86400)) = 0 - 0 = 0

 5) You don't theres literally a 99 percent chance you stay there for 1.15 seconds and even if you do get stuck for longer 
 it's literally impossible to be stuck in it for more than a day. It's literally proved in problem four
