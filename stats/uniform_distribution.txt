      {  k if x in [a,b]
p(x) {
      {  0 if x not in [a, b]

A)

integral of p(x) from - infinity to a then from a to b then from b to infinity

the integrals with infinity equal zero so they don't matter

from a to b it would be kb - ka or k(b-a) so if this equals 1 then it would be

k = 1/( b- a) 

B) this would be integral of p(x) from - infinity to x so it would be - infinity to A
then a to b then b to x

the - infinity integral doesnt matter then from a to b its the equation above k(b-a)

and from b to x i believe it would be zero because it isn't in the bounds of a and b but it
could also be kx - kb but I'm not sure

C) integral of x p(x)

so split up again the outside infinity integrals don't matter so it would be

x p(x) from a to b and that integral would be xk from a to b

which ends up being x^2 over 2 * k from a to b
so that ends up being (x^2/2) (b - a)

D) The integral from - infinity to infinity of (x - E[x])^2 

the oytside infinities don't matter so its just from a to b  

(x - (x^2/2) (b - a))^ 2 = x^2  - 2 (x) (x^2/2) (b - a) + ((x^2/2) (b - a)) ^ 2

= x^3 / 3 - ((2x^4)/4)(b-a) +  x^5/20(b-a)^2 and plug in the b and a's you get

b^3 / 3 - ((2b^4)/4)(b-a) +  b^5/20(b-a)^2 - (a^3 / 3 - ((2a^4)/4)(b-a) +  a^5/20(b-a)^2)
