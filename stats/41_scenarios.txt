Scenario 1) Logistic instead of linear:
Road Trip Gas Money:
Every gallon you use costs a certain amount so its a linear progression of gallons to miles
For some reason you think that the more you fill up a tank the longer it will last as in you put in 20 gallons at once 
and it would somehow last longer than putting it in throughout the trip.
This is logistic because the more you put in the longer you think it will last but thats not the case, you end up 
budgeting the wrong amount of gaas money and now you're out of gas money for the road trip and you're stranded

Scenario 2) Linear instead og Logistic:
Video Game Progress Boosters:
You forget there is a max level or progression in a game, you start new but throughout you can buy consumable progression
boosters, you end up buying way too many progress boosters off the bat and end up hitting the progression cap with still a 
ton of leftover progression boosters now you wasted money on all these progression boosters for nothing
